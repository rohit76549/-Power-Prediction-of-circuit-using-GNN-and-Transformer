# -Power-Prediction-of-circuit-using-GNN-and-Transformer
Predicts Quality of Result (QoR / power) for a given circuit (AIG netlist) and a synthesis recipe using a hybrid Graph Neural Network + Causal Transformer with multi-layer cross-attention, and uses the learned predictor to drive fast Model-based MCTS recipe search.
